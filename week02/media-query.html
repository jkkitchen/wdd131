            <p>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will
                take upon him
                their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know
                according to the
                flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>

                that thy name may
                be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them;</p>
